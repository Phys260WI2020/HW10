    "# Computer Homework #10: Inductors in Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will examine the effect of inductors in circuits, and introduce the concept of alternating-current circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The canonical example of an inductor is a solenoid. When you run a current through a solenoid, it develops a magnetic field. If this current is changing, the magnetic field in the solenoid is changing too. And if that happens, the solenoid experiences a changing magnetic flux through itself. Faraday's law tells us that this will result in an emf in the solenoid that's in a direction to oppose the change in flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "The induced emf in the solenoid is proportional to the rate of change of the current, so we can write it as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    V_L = -L\\frac{dI}{dt}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$L$ is a proportionality constant called the <b>inductance</b>. It's measured in Henries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like capacitance, inductance is a geometrical quantity. We'll calculate it explicitly for a solenoid in class. Physically, inductors prevent currents from changing too quickly. If $dI/dt$ is large, the inductor will generate a large opposing emf that limits the current. Surge protectors are basically big inductors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inductors contribute to Kirchhoff's loop rule, just like resistors, capacitors, and batteries do. So we can solve circuits with inductors using techniques similar to what you did in Computer Homework #6. You will want to have that assignment at hand when starting this one."
